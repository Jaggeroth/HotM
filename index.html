    <p>It's either very late or very early when you crash onto the sofa and turn on the TV. It's on your favourite news channel, the only one that's willing to entertain the idea that you might be trying to help. They are running highlights from your latest fight. Five against one. You get a chill seeing how barely you make your escape. But hey, the police aren't shooting at you anymore. So that's an improvement.</p>
	
	<p>Then you hear it. A soft and gentle knock from somewhere close. You turn your head. The knocking comes again, more insistent this time. It seems to be coming from a door on the apartment wall behind you. Except that door was not there a moment ago. Not knowing what else to do you open it. There is a person standing there. They are talking but you don't take in a word they say and just stare at the scene behind them. A vast multilevel complex resembling an airport or shopping centre, it extends as far as you can see. All fitting neatly where your hall should be.</p>
	
	<p>Your unexpected guide escorts you past many colourfully dress individuals to an "induction suite" that would be right at home in any business hotel. Four similarly bewildered individuals take their seats as a film begins to play. It tells a story set in another world. How that world's first superman took to the streets to fight crime and keep the world safe. How the villains continued to get more powerful and the challenge ever harder. Despite the risk, through it all the superman continued to prevail. Eventually the villains he faced would have the power to crack planets and move suns, yet still he triumphed. Until a final battle where the forces unleashed were so great reality itself was torn asunder.</p>
	
	<p>The superman wakes to find himself floating in a void. As his strength returns he makes his way to a distant star, but as he draws closer he realises it is something else entirely. Not a star, but an entire reality. What he mistook for a spiral galaxy was in fact a host of realities, an interconnected multiverse. Gazing into the nearest, he sees a world much like his own, a lone hero much like himself, struggling and outnumbered. Instinctively he enters this reality, his own has been lost but this one can still be saved.</p>
	
	<p>For years he fights alongside this worlds guardian. Utilising his strength and his foresight, they win many battles and overcome impossible odds. Yet the powers they face still escalate and they are dragged ever closer to the same inevitable end and another reality shatters.</p>
	
	<p>Two supermen wake to find themselves floating in a void. They approach the nearest reality, more determined than ever. The story repeats. More success, yet more desperation as no matter what they do the world becomes unstable and a third reality collapses.</p>
	
	<p>Three supermen wake to find themselves floating in a void. They approach the nearest reality, but this time they hesitate. How many lives have been lost to their failures? Not just their Earths, but countless other planets circling an infinite number of stars.</p>
	
	<p>Silently they commune with each other. Haven't they proven that power alone is not the solution? They study the multiverse, detecting the invisible tendrils that extend from one reality to the next in a web of interconnected probability. They see how events in one world increase the likelihood of similar events happening in its neighbours. By entering another reality, might they have infected it with something of the chaotic nature of their own? Did they not realise their god-like power could destabilise any reality they entered?</p>
	
	<p>The three supermen gaze into the fourth reality. This time they will remain outside. Using nothing but will power they contact "sensitives" who in turn contact this world's leading superman. They convince them of the future they face and impart their advice. They council early and brutal intervention and they are persuasive. For the first time, the chaos begins to recede and the inevitable does not happen.</p>
	
	<p>Once they are sure the reality is safe, they review their success and they are not happy. They have built a totalitarian regime, powers are the property of the world government and all individuality has been crushed. Are their ideals incompatible with basic survival? They refuse to accept it. Perhaps if they intervene earlier? Could they influence the nature of people with powers? Could they nudge emerging superhumans along a more righteous path?</p>
	
	<p>So, The Three choose a different path. They find realities where superhumans are still new and rather than enter the realities themselves, they enable heroes from nearby worlds to cross over and help each other. This strategy increases the chance that other superhumans pick the path of hero rather than villain and by working on a network of realities, every success improves the outcomes of its neighbours. Gradually whole sections of the multiverse stabilise.</p>
	
	<p>The film ends and the guide takes to the stage. "Heroes", he says. "Now you understand the true risks in your future. Should your worlds succumb to chaos reality itself will be ripped apart."</p>
	
	<p>"You have been selected for your resolve and together we believe you can save your worlds. Not just by defeating your enemies, but by lighting a path for those that follow."</p>
	
	<p>"You need to work together", the guide meets the eyes of everyone in turn. "We have seen familiar events unfold on world after world. The same villains mirrored again and again. We will use this knowledge to predict how events will unfold in your home. We will enable you to travel to each other's worlds, to provide each other that essential backup you so desperately need. In short we will supply you every aid we can that will not itself risk the stability of your realities and together we are confident you can save your worlds."</p>
	
	<p>You wake in your bedroom, having overslept again. The events of the previous night come rushing back. Momentarily too afraid to believe, you nervously make your way to the living room. A new door sits on the wall. A new door with a strange key that opens to the space behind the multiverse.</p>
